# EDW Feedback

This repository has been created for testers and users of [Token Flow](https://tokenflow.live/)'s Ethereum Data Warehouse (EDW) to report issues and for the team to track progress on issues being worked on.

For common "getting started" questions (or to sign up for EDW) please see the [documentation](https://docs.tokenflow.live/).

## Reporting issues, bugs and feature requests

You can report issues, bugs, feature requests by opening a new issue [here](https://github.com/TokenFlowInsights/EDW-Feedback/issues).

All triaged issues identified by Beta testers up to 29 November 2022 have been added by the team.

## Tracking progress on issue resolution

The team maintains a Project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/TokenFlowInsights/projects/1) where you can see progress on issues raised by testers and also identified by the team.
