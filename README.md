# EDW Beta Feedback

This repository has been created for Beta testers to report issues and for the team to track progress on issues being worked on.

## Reporting issues, bugs and feature requests

You can report issues, bugs, feature requests by opening a new issue [here](https://github.com/TokenFlowInsights/EDW-Beta-Feedback/issues)

## Tracking progress on issue resolution

The team maintains a Project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/TokenFlowInsights/projects/1) where you can see progress on issues raised by testers and also identified by the team.
